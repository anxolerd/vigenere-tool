Vigenere encryptor/decryptor
============================

It it available at http://anxolerd.github.io/vigenere-tool

Overview
--------

This repository contains extremely dumb implementation for `vigenere cipher`_ encryption/decryption tool, which I have implemented while `preparing the exam for networks course`_.
It is written in plain javascript with simple stylesheets without any third-party libraries.

Choices explained
-----------------

The alphabet is extremely limited because it was the required minimum for the exam. Non-latin characters like Cyrillic are not supported because the emulator we used did not support Cyrillic characters.


Aknowledgments

Special thanks to `@LdmlD`_ and `@ttatus`_ for testing this in the real-world (at the exam).
